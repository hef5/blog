This is a demo project for learning and practicing Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA. The tech stacks used in this project are Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA, MySQL. In this branch, JWT Authorization was employed to replace Session and to make the Web application stateless, I use Ajax to add the Authorization header for every request. The front end of this project is written with jQuery, ajax and some js lib for more features. Thanks to the JWT the admin part becomes a single page application and the whole project now is stateless.   

## Project Demo
The reason why I made this project stateless is that I want to try Cloud Run of the GCP. Stateless is a requirement of using Cloud Run. The following is a link of my blog website in Cloud Run which can serve as a demo of this project.
